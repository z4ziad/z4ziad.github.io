Hi, I am a Teaching Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. I created this website to share my latest contributions. Recently, I am really proud of creating two new ECE courses, [Embedded Deep Learning](/mbed_dl/mbed_dl) and [Autonomous Robotics 1](/auto_robo/auto_robo).  

I am also [an artist](https://www.instagram.com/ziad.youssfi/), a maker, and a tinkerer. I hope to find time soon to write on [my blog](/index.html) about my journey from a curious child tinkerer growing up in Damascus, Syria, to an engineering faculty member. For now, you can check [my faculty page at CMU](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/Ziad%20Youssfi.html) or get my CV [here](/pdf/Ziad Youssfi's CV 2024 (no phone).pdf).
