I am excited to offer [Autonomous Robotics 1](/auto_robo/auto_robo) for the second time this Spring, 2025. When I first offered it in the Spring of 2024, it was fun and fulfilling for the students to come in with no background in machine learning or robotics and, by the end of the semester, build robots that could track objects.   

I am still developing the course and making changes, which will continue for the next couple of iterations of the course.  Here are some of the changes I would like to make:
* Change the robot base chassis and driver to the [Rasprover](https://www.waveshare.com/rasprover.htm) base. This should work with the Jetson Orin Nano (now called Jetson Orin Nano Super and has higher performance.)
* Expand the coverage of ROS2 and IsaacROS to include AprilTags, VSLAM, and possibly simple navigation.
* Create the teaching kit to replace the current NVIDIA Robotics Teaching Kit.  
* Integrate the [SMACC2 library](https://github.com/robosoft-ai/SMACC2) for creating behavioral state machines.

_Onward and forward!_
