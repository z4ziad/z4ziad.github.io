The goal of this project is to design a real-time deer detection system for vehicles using
embedded technology. We use sensor fusion (thermal imaging, TOF sensors) and onboard
processing to catch deer near the road and warn drivers faster than they can react. If the
system catches a deer, it can trigger alerts like flashing lights or braking assist to help drivers
stay safe.
