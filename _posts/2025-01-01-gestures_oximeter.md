This project aims to replicate the Apple Watch double-tap feature using on-device
machine learning with an Arduino Nano BLE Sense 33. The device leverages its built-in
accelerometer, gyroscope, and an externally attached MAX30102 oximeter sensor 1 to detect
gestures such as double-tap, clench, and rotate. The hardware is housed in a 3D-printed
wearable enclosure, mimicking a smartwatch form factor. This system has the potential to
improve accessibility, especially for individuals with disabilities or those needing single-handed
operation. The final system achieves a gesture detection accuracy of 94%, with robust
classification performance across five gesture classes (including idle and other).
