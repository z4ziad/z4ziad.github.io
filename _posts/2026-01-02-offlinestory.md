What: An offline bedtime-story companion on Jetson Orin Nano that generates and narrates
kid-safe stories using a tiny LLM + STT/TTS. It is a new product built from open-source components (LLM, TTS) with a safety-first pipeline. Our objective is to deliver safe, customizable, internet-free storytelling with less than 5s start-to-speech latency via streaming. It is meant for children (end users), parents/educators (buyers/custodians).
