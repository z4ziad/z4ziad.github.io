Our project implements a real-time baseball detection and scoring system using YOLOv8 for object
detection and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for external device communication. The system integrates a
webcam to capture live video frames, processes them with a pre-trained YOLOv8m model to detect baseballs,
and overlays detection results with bounding boxes and confidence scores. Simultaneously, a BLE client receives
predictions from an Arduino-powered external device, enabling enhanced interaction and data integration. A
scoring mechanism updates dynamically based on baseball detections and BLE input, providing a seamless user
experience. Our solution demonstrates the potential of combining modern computer vision and BLE
communication for interactive sports analytics.
