The Virtual Boxing Trainer project aims to revolutionize boxing training by integrating wearable
technology with intelligent data analysis. Using Arduino Nano BLE 33 boards equipped with inertial
measurement units (IMUs), this system records, classifies, and analyzes boxing moves, delivering an
interactive and engaging training experience for users. Designed for fitness enthusiasts, professional boxers,
coaches, and gyms, the trainer provides a real-time prediction of punch types, enabling users to instantly
identify and assess their movements. It also gives real-time feedback on performance metrics such as the
number of punches thrown in each punch category (Punch, Hook, Upper, and Block) and the punch power.
Additionally, it classifies users into skill levels (beginner, intermediate, or advanced) based on the total
punches they have thrown. The trainer evaluates punch power of users, categorizing it as low, moderate, or
high, by capturing and analyzing the real-time punch power of each punch. A user interface (UI) has been
developed to enhance the usability and accessibility of the system. The UI allows users to view their real-
time prediction punch types, training performance metrics including the punch count of each punch
category, and power categorization, in an intuitive and visually engaging manner.
