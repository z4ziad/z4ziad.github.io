AirDrums: a virtual drum set powered by deep learning. AirDrums packages an entire
drumset into just a wristband with built-in sensors. By wearing the wristband and making
the motions of hitting a drum set with a drumstick, we can use deep learning to identify
the motion made and which drum the user pretended to hit to play the drum noise. Drum
sets are large, unwieldy, and loud. AirDrums solves all of these problems by providing a
new, portable, drum set that drummers can use to practice anywhere. What sets
AirDrums apart from existing virtual drumsets is there there is no need for any extra
equipment other than the wristband. Existing virtual drumsets use specialized
drumsticks, a camera, and require a well-lit room to track the user’s movements.
AirDrums does not have any of those limitations, and is truly a portable drumset that
allow users to use their favorite drumsticks to practice drumming on the go.
