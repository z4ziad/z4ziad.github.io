The objective for this project is to build a device for MRI technologists and researchers who need reliable articulatory data without wasting scanner time. The ALFORM system IS A real-time articulatory tracking tool that shows which articulators are being used and how often, while you scan. Unlike expensive trial-and-error experiments that only discover missing articulators after the fact, this device gives instant feedback so you can focus on the right movements and collect better data, faster
