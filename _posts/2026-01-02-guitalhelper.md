Guitar Helper: an embedded ML system that listens to short audio snippets
of strummed chords and classifies them in real time. Beginners struggle with chord memorization and fast chord changes. It is also difficult to find chord progressions online for less popular songs. We wanted to create a palm-sized “Guitar Helper” that listens to songs and lights up the next chord on the fretboard (fingerboard) in real time using an embedded ML model.
