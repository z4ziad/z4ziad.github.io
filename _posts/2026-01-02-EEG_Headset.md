Electroencephalogram (EEG), also known as “brain wave”, is a promising brain computer
interface (BCI) technology that is low-cost and noninvasive. Our goal is to build a prototype device that can read EEG, decode the user intent, and use that to control an Arduino Car. The target users would be disabled people who need a different way to control things, hobbyists wanting to try out BCI technologies, and researchers working on EEG related projects. We offer an Embedded ML solution that has low latency for real time control; is affordable (no data transmission and cloud processing costs); is reliable with no need for internet connection; and is private, as users’ EEG signals are sensitive data.
