I enjoy driving my car both in India and in Pittsburgh. However, I have occasionally experienced
challenges in detecting and responding to stop signs in a timely manner. This experience has motivated me to design a Stop Sign Recognition and Alert System. The goal of this system is to enhance driver
awareness and improve road safety.  

The red light on top of the car indicates approaching the stop sign too fast.
