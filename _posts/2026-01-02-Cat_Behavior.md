Our Goal is to develop a wearable device that classifies cat behaviors (e.g., rest, walk,
feed) using motion sensor data as a cat-mounted smart collar system. Our motivation is to catch early changes in cat behavior that may signal cat health issues, and our objective to enable continuous, real-time cat behavior tracking for activity analysis and health monitoring. The target users are cat owners (especially busy owners), vets, and rescue groups who need continuous activity and behavior tracking.
