Self-learning anything can be challenging. Our device, the PocketPro, is an embedded device that
can be attached to a glove to allow table tennis enthusiasts and beginners to conveniently train their
technique in practice by utilizing motion classification to classify and compare a userâ€™s actions with
professional data. The PocketPro will also be displaying their serve data via an accessible screen. With
this comparison, we will generate actionable insights for the user to improve their gameplay.
