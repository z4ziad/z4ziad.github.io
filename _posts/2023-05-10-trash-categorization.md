The key feature of SBTrashCat is to use the acoustic fingerprint of containers made with different materials to determine their categorization. For our baseline, SBTrashCat can identify containers including aluminum cans, plastic bottles, and tetra-pak. To ensure the robustness of the system, noise and human voice were also added in the categorization to eliminate noise interference. A special trash can was built for data collection and validation.
