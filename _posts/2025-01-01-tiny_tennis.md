Tiny Tennis Coach is a wearable device strapped to a player’s wrist that can analyze a
player’s swing and provide targeted feedback to help improve a player’s form. Inspired by our own
experiences playing tennis, we aimed to create a convenient and real-time learning aid for beginners
to get feedback on their swing. Tiny Tennis Coach analyzes accelerometer and gyroscope
information from a player’s swing and uses an edge-AI model deployed on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE
Sense to classify the swing type and quality, then generates textual advice using a large language
model (GPT-4o-mini), which is displayed on an OLED screen for the player to read. In this report,
we discuss our methodology, results, and lessons learned.
