DuoGuard represents a significant advancement in elderly care monitoring systems, combining
audio and motion detection through a dual-board TinyML implementation. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of our system, which achieves 90% detection accuracy while maintaining strict
privacy standards through on-device processing. The solution addresses the critical need for non-
invasive elderly monitoring systems that can provide reliable emergency detection while preserving
dignity and independence.
