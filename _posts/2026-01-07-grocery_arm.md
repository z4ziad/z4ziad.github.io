We all use mobile shopping apps. Sometimes, we find it convenient to call an Uber Eat or do curbside pickup. However, it still takes time for the associates to pick up the items for
us. Can we make it more convenient for both the customer and the staff working in the shop?  

We are trying to make a dual-arm robot with mobile base to:
* Self-identify grocery items on the shelf.    
* Automatically identify, scan, and calculate the 6D pose of the target items.  
* Plan and execute the optimal trajectory to pick the item from the shelf and place into basket.  
* Maintain safety during the whole process.  

After entering the prompt: "garbanzo beans can", the robot arm finds and picks the correct can.
