## Course Description  
---  
This course combines machine learning and robotics in a hands-on approach that encourages discovery. The course will have three portions. First, students learn deep learning fundamentals, convolutional neural networks, and object detection. In the second portion, students learn the fundamentals of Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2). In the last portion, they learn how to implement ROS2 computational graphs and machine learning models on a hardware and software acceleration platform to achieve real-time robotic perception, cognition, and action. Students develop a miniature self-driving robot based on the Jetson Orin Nano platform and the RealSense camera for vision. Students are encouraged to discover their robotic application tasks. Prior machine learning or robotics knowledge is not required. However, strong C/Python programming skills, computer systems knowledge, and a sense of wonder are strongly preferred. This course is crosslisted with 18842. Although students in 18442 will share lectures with students in 18842, students in 18842 will be given exams and project criteria that will be more challenging than those in 18442.   

## Why I Created this Course
---
I have always wanted to create a course to engage students with robotics on a scale that fits in one room or at a tabletop. Seeing the progress made at NVIDIA with their [IsaacROS library](https://github.com/NVIDIA-ISAAC-ROS) and the [Jetson platform](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/), I realized that a tiny robot can now execute smart tasks just as well as its bigger and older ancestors could. 

An essential aspect of this course is allowing students to learn about integrating machine learning and autonomy in the physical world. Like the [Embedded Deep Learning course](/mbed_dl/mbed_dl), this course is not just about machine learning models running in the cloud but also about how these models perform on robots in the real world _when the rubber hits the road!_
