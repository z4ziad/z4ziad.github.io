## Course Description  
---  
This “quest” model course engages students with project-based robotic challenges. Students form teams and use a human-centered design process to select a robotic use case. To solve their challenge, they employ the foundation they built in Autonomous Robotics I: ROS2, supervised machine learning, and an accelerated software stack. Students can leverage new robotic techniques, including VSLAM (Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), path planning, image segmentation, 3D scene reconstruction, and pose estimation. Students are encouraged to employ generative AI models such as VLA (Vision Language Action) to solve their challenges.   
Students in 18-448 will have a different grading rubric for project assessment.

## Why I Created this Course
---
I intentionally made this course an open project course so students can apply the knowledge they gained in Autonomous Robotics II. Students can form groups around real-life use-cases. Moreover, students can push the envelop with the machine learning and generative AI integration.
